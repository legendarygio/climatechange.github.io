          What is Climate Change?
      </h2>
      <p>Climate Change is basically a change in climate from a certain place. Climate change usually causes a regions climate to
         get warmer. Climate Change could cause a change in the weather from a season. Some examples are less rain in Spring or less
          snow in Winter.</p>

      <h3>
          Why is Climate Change an Important Issue?
      </h3>
      <p> Climate change is important because it is changing things in a bad way. For example, it will cause more droughts and heat 
        waves to occur. It will also cause the earth to get hotter which will affect the seasons and the climate. The reason this is
         a problem is because although the weather can change within hours, climate can take hundreds of years to change. This can also
          be bad for agriculture because of precipitation levels. Since climate change can affect seasons, it can prevent plants from 
          growing productively due to more heat and decreasing levels of rain.</p>

      <h2>How does Climate Change Impact the World?</h2>
      <h3>Ice and Snow Melting</h3>
      <p><a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/climate.html#:~:text=Snow's%20cold%2C%20moist%20surface%20influences,from%20evaporating%20into%20the%20atmosphere" target="_blank">According to a source</a>, The cold, moist surface from snow influences how much heat and moisture circulate between the ground and the
         atmosphere. Snow helps insulate the ground below, holding in heat and preventing moisture from evaporating into the 
         atmosphere. This impacts the world because without snow, there would be much more heat and the air would most likely be 
         humid.</p>
      <h3>Ocean Levels Rising</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/sea-level-rise/#close" target="_blank">A source</a> states the following: In 2014, global sea level was 2.6 inches above the 1993 average. Sea level continues to rise at
         a rate of about one-eighth of an inch per year. This impacts the world because the rising sea levels can cause dangerous 
         hurricanes and powerful storm surges. The rising sea levels can also force people to move to higher ground due to the fact that
          some areas can get flooded. </p>
        <h3>Violent Weather Occuring</h3>
        <p>This includes weather like droughts, heat waves, and hurricanes. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/" target="_blank">Information from a source</a> states that the year 1980 had 291 
          catastrophic weather events while 2014 had 904 events! Ever since 1980, more extreme weather extreme weather events have
           been happening. This will impact the world because looking at the graph, it looks like the numbers will keep increasing
            unless we start to do something about it.</p>

    <div id="climate-change-existing-evidence">
      <h2>How Do We Know Climate Change Exists?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The first piece of evidence is that the ocean absorbs much of the heat from the sun. The ocean stores more than 90% of the energy from the sun
           in the ocean. The top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of the ocean have been warming more than 0.6 degrees fahrenheit
            (0.33 degrees celsius) since 1969.</li>
        <li>The next piece of evidence is that global sea levels have increased about 8 inches (20 cm) in the last century. The rate for
           the last two decades is nearly double the amount of the last century. The amount keeps increasing a bit every year.</li>
        <li>The third piece of evidence is that the average surface temperature of the earth has risen about 2.05 degrees fahrenheit 
          since the late 19th century. Most of the warming has happened in the past 40 years. 2016 has been the hottest year with the
           months January through September being the hottest.</li>
        <li>The last piece of evidence is that the number of high temperature events in the US has been increasing while the number of
           low temperature events has been decreasing since 1950. There has also been increasing numbers of intense rainfall events.</li>

      <h2>How Can Individuals Reduce Their Impact on Climate Change?</h2>
       <h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
       <p>Try something powered with wind or solar energy. If you have enough money to buy an electric car or to buy solar panels,
          you should get it. Carbon dioxide can be bad if there is too much of it in the air. Solar panels or an electric car can 
          reduce CO2 emissions from 7 to 10 percent by 2050.</p>
        <h3>Short Showers</h3>
        <p>Taking shorter showers and turning off water while brushing your teeth can help. This is due to the fact that it takes a lot
           of energy to pump, heat, and treat your water. If 1 out of 100 American homes did this, 80,000 tons of pollution will be
            avoided.</p>
        <h3>LED Lights</h3>
        <p>LED lights consume 80% less energy than lightbulbs on average. They do not contain any harmful mercury and require less
           energy to produce the same lighting as a light bulb. Although they do cost more than light bulbs, they last much longer.</p>
        <h3>Unplugging Unused Outlets</h3>
        <p>About 65 different devices in an average home are plugged and most are not being used. The amount of energy used in all US 
          households is added up to about 50 large power plants.</p>

    <div id="communities-reducing-climate-change-impact">
      <h2>How Can Communities, Cities, Countries Reduce Climate Change Impact?</h2>
       <h3>Correct Building Location</h3>
       <p>The closer homes are to buildings like stores, clinics, and schools, the easier it will be to just walk since you will get
          there in time. This will help out since you will not need cars to get to your destination because the buildings are closer
           to each other.</p>
       <h3>Improving Our Connection</h3>
       <p>We need to adjust our sidewalks so there can be more intersections that people can walk through. This will allow for people 
         to walk comfortably. We can also make our roads more narrow so fewer cars can go through them. This is important because cars
          are a big issue when it comes to climate change.</p>
       <h3>Recycling Clothes</h3>
       <p>A lot of clothing is made from organic material and gets thrown into landfills. However, landfills lack the oxygen needed for
          organic material to break down. After, the clothing goes through a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion" target="_blank">Anaerobic Aigestion</a>. This process can 
          produce methane, which will to the air and harms the quality of it. Recycling 100 million pounds of clothes is equivalent
           to removing about 35,000 cars from the road.</p>
       <h3>Food Waste</h3>
       <p>If we waste less food, we are cutting down on energy consumption. About 10% of the US energy goes into growing and processing
          food. The bad thing is that 40% of it is wasted and goes into landfill.</p>
